# Web Scraping

## Description
This project demonstrates an efficient approach to web scraping using Python's BeautifulSoup, Requests, and Pandas libraries. It automates data extraction from web sources, structures the data for easy manipulation, and serves as a practical learning resource for web scraping techniques.

## Tools and Technology Used
- **BeautifulSoup** (`beautifulsoup4`): Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents, facilitating data extraction from web pages.
- **Requests** (`requests`): Python library for making HTTP requests and handling responses from web servers.
- **Pandas** (`pandas`): Python library for data manipulation and analysis, used here to organize and process the scraped data into structured formats like DataFrames.

## Methodology
1. **HTTP Requests**: Utilizes Requests to fetch HTML pages from a specified website.
2. **HTML Parsing**: Employs BeautifulSoup to parse and navigate through the HTML structure, extracting relevant data elements based on specified criteria.
3. **Data Structuring**: Organizes the extracted data into structured formats such as Pandas DataFrames, enabling further analysis, visualization, or storage.

## Expected Outcomes
- **Automated Data Extraction**: Successfully retrieves targeted data from web sources, automating the extraction process.
- **Structured Data Storage**: Stores scraped data in a structured format, facilitating easy access and manipulation.
- **Learning Resource**: Serves as a practical example for learning web scraping techniques in Python, illustrating integration of BeautifulSoup, Requests, and Pandas for effective data extraction and management.
