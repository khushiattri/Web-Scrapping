# Web-Scrapping 
This Python project demonstrates web scraping capabilities using BeautifulSoup, Requests, and Pandas libraries. It allows users to extract structured data from a specified website, leveraging BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing, Requests for making HTTP requests, and Pandas for organizing the scraped data into a structured format.
Tools and Technology Used:
BeautifulSoup (beautifulsoup4): Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents, facilitating data extraction from web pages.
Requests (requests): Python library for making HTTP requests and handling responses from web servers.
Pandas (pandas): Python library for data manipulation and analysis, used here to organize and process the scraped data into structured formats like DataFrames.
Methodology:
This project demonstrates an efficient approach to web scraping using Python's BeautifulSoup, Requests, and Pandas libraries:

HTTP Requests: Utilizes Requests to fetch HTML pages from a specified website.
HTML Parsing: Employs BeautifulSoup to parse and navigate through the HTML structure, extracting relevant data elements based on specified criteria.
Data Structuring: Organizes the extracted data into structured formats such as Pandas DataFrames, enabling further analysis, visualization, or storage.
Expected Outcomes:
Automated Data Extraction: Successfully retrieves targeted data from web sources, automating the extraction process.
Structured Data Storage: Stores scraped data in a structured format, facilitating easy access and manipulation.
Learning Resource: Serves as a practical example for learning web scraping techniques in Python, illustrating integration of BeautifulSoup, Requests, and Pandas for effective data extraction and management.
